# Mech103---Algorithms
These are some of the algorithms I created for labs/projects in Mech103 - Intro to Mechanical Engineering
**All of this code was used in conjuction with an Arduino**
## This folder includes:
* a file that makes the Arduino flash a light (blinky_arduino)
* a file that turns on a colored arduino light based off of the force acted on the sensor (lab_8)
* a file that turns on a light that corresponds to the distance between the arduino and an object (lab_9)
* a file that plays a sound from the arduino that changes based on the button pressed (lab_10)
